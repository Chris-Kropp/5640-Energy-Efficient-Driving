# 5640-Energy-Efficient-Driving
This project has four core requirements:
- [Carla Simulator](http://carla.org/)
  - By default, `agent.py` should be placed in Carla's root directory.
  - The variable `CARLA_Path` on line 17 may be updated to reflect the location of CARLA's start script.
- [EVPRE energy estimator](https://github.com/USU-Software-Engineering/EVPRE)
  - The contents of this repository should be copied to the same location as `agent.py`.
- [pip requirements](https://github.com/Chris-Kropp/5640-Energy-Efficient-Driving/blob/main/requirements.txt)
- [conda requirements](https://github.com/Chris-Kropp/5640-Energy-Efficient-Driving/blob/main/conda%20requirements)

This project assumes a linux environment and uses the following commands:
- `` kill `pidof CarlaUE4-Linux-Shipping` ``
- `bash CarlaUE4.sh`
